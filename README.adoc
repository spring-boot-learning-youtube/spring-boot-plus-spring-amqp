This is the source code you can find for my YouTube video:

You can either:

A) Run the `RabbitTest`, which uses Testcontainers to spin up a RabbitMQ broker, run the test, and shut it down or...

B) Start up RabbitMQ like this:

```
docker run -it --rm --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management
```

Then run `DemoApplication`. It will talk to the broker you just spun up.

Play around with it and let us know what you did in the comments!
